# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project: Bellabeat Case Study

This is a capstone project that I have recently completed as part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). Course participants can learn the following:

* Gain an immersive understanding of the practices and processes used by a junior or associate data analyst in their day-to-day job
* Learn key analytical skills (data cleaning, analysis, & visualization) and tools (spreadsheets, SQL, R programming, Tableau)
* Understand how to clean and organize data for analysis, and complete analysis and calculations using spreadsheets, SQL and R programming
* Learn how to visualise and present data findings in dashboards, presentations and commonly used visualisation platforms

The analysis follows the six steps of data analysis taught in the Google programme: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share, and Act.

## Background
Bellabeat was founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur in 2014. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on [their website](https://bellabeat.com/).

Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Business Task:
To identify and analyse trends in smart device usage data in order to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. These insights will then guide the marketing strategy for the company.

## Guiding Questions:
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Tools Used:
- MySQL for Data Cleaning
- R and Tableau for Data Analysis and Data Visualisation

## Dataset:
The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).
