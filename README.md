# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project: Bellabeat Case Study

This is a capstone project that I have recently completed as part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). Course participants can learn the following:

* Gain an immersive understanding of the practices and processes used by a junior or associate data analyst in their day-to-day job
* Learn key analytical skills (data cleaning, analysis, & visualization) and tools (spreadsheets, SQL, R programming, Tableau)
* Understand how to clean and organize data for analysis, and complete analysis and calculations using spreadsheets, SQL and R programming
* Learn how to visualise and present data findings in dashboards, presentations and commonly used visualisation platforms

The analysis follows the six steps of data analysis taught in the Google programme: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share, and Act.

## Background
Bellabeat was founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur in 2014. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on [their website](https://bellabeat.com/).

Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Business Task
To identify and analyse trends in smart device usage data in order to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. These insights will then guide the marketing strategy for the company.

## Guiding Questions
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Tools Used
- MySQL for Data Cleaning
- R and Tableau for Data Analysis and Data Visualisation

Tableau visualisations can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleDataAnalyticsCapstoneProject-BellabeatCaseStudyVisualisationsDanielPoe/BellabeatCapstoneProjectStory?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).

## Key Findings
- Not all users utilised the sleep tracker and weight log.
- The least popular feature in the fitness tracker is the weight log
  function.
- User engagement decreased by 36% throughout the one-month period.
- In terms of the days of the week, users were most active on Tuesdays
  and Saturdays.
- Most of the time is spent in sedentary activities, with some time
  spent on light-intensity activities.
- Users were active from 8 am to 8 pm, and were most active between 5 to
  8 pm, followed by 12 to 3 pm.
- Although users have relatively sufficient sleep on average, they
  seemed to have problems falling asleep. The amount of sleep they have
  per day is inconsistent and often less than the recommended minimum of
  7 h per day.

## Recommendations
- **Further Analysis on the Weight Log Function**

  Seeing that there were only eight out of 33 users who used the weight
  log function, data collection on it (e.g. in the form of a survey)
  should be conducted to understand why users do not use it. Such a
  study would provide user insights into the function and inform
  Bellabeat on how they can perhaps improve on the weight log function.

- **Promote Device Use while Sleeping**

  People tend to remove watches before going to sleep. Bellabeat should
  encourage device users to continue wearing their devices when going to
  bed, so that Bellabeat will be able to collect more data on users’
  sleep patterns. Users will also be able to gain insights from their
  sleep data and make helpful decisions for them to get enough sleep.

- **Sleep Notifications**

  Since users often do not have the recommended amount of sleep per day,
  we can consider to have a feature on the Bellabeat app that allows
  users to specify a time they desire to go to sleep. The app can then
  notify the user some time before that time to prepare going to sleep.
  Since users struggle to fall asleep, prompting them to go to bed earlier than the set time can help users to fall asleep on time and have sufficient rest.

- **Step and Activity Notifications**

  In order to encourage users to take more steps, Bellabeat can set up
  app notifications at different times of the day to make users
  conscious of the number of steps they have taken and motivate them to
  meet the daily minimum requirement of 8,00 steps by the U.S. CDC.
  Additional information on the health benefits of walking the daily
  recommended number of steps can also be included in the app to educate
  users about its benefits.

  Prolonged sedentary activity alerts can also be set up, which will
  prompt users to get up and engage in some form of physical activity
  like walking. Additional information can also be included in the app
  about the dangers of highly sedentary activity, such as information
  published by [WHO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK566046/).

- **Online Campaign Recommendations**

  The online campaign should not portray the Bellabeat app as merely a
  fitness activity app. Rather, it should promote the app as a guide
  that will allow women to strike a balance between their personal and
  work lives, and to improve their health habits through education and
  daily app notifications.
